#  Capstone Project - Pheonix Fast Food
In this project, I demonstrated my ability  to build a web site from design. I made a fictitious company, and I used the layout color and topography dictated by adobe file of the [designer](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX), 
This fictitious company,[Pheonix](https://online-fast-food.netlify.app) is in a fast food company that delivers fast food at doorsteps from the nearby kitchens. The content of this website doesn't hold a factual data.
